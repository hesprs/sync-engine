### Complete Rewrite from Ground Up

- Completely rewritten the plugin with new modular architecture and extend support to all kinds of backends.

- Sync Engine also extends beyond WebDAV with the **S3-compatible backend support**, more backends like Google Drive and Dropbox will become as easy as writing a module.
- Plugin performance is greatly improved, enhancements include faster startup, and [Anchored Asymmetric Storage](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/asymmetric-storage) that accelerates every sync, [benchmarks show that Sync Engine is around 100x faster than Remotely Save in daily sync scenario](https://sync.consensia.cc/usage/benchmark#webdav-performance).

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.3.0 - 2026-04-13

**Note: breaking change present (moved WebDAV credential into secret store), but auto-migration available. The real intrusion is zero for most users.**

### Security / credentials

- Store WebDAV credentials in Obsidian’s credential storage instead of plaintext settings.
- Added a migration that moves existing plaintext tokens into the secret store.

### Sync engine / behavior

- Supported syncing the `.obsidian/` config folder (excluded by default).

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.2.0 - 2026-04-11

### Memory and performance optimizations

- Replaced the rxjs-based sync event bus with lightweight hooks/ref helpers, simplifying sync state propagation across the modal, ribbon, commands, unload flow, and related UI/services.
- Refactored sync task handling and logging to reduce noise, tighten typing, remove unnecessary async/await patterns, and simplify progress summary structures.
- Changed planning to create tasks directly from current file stats instead of snapshot-based planning, and moved file-content loading into push/pull/merge tasks for lazier, more targeted fetches.
- Removed the planning “deciding” substage and updated progress/i18n text accordingly.
- Introduced a maxConcurrentSyncTasks setting and updated task optimization to chunk work by the new concurrency limit.
- Raised the default maxConcurrentWebDAVCalls to 100 and migrated existing configs from 0.

### Sync correctness and compatibility

- Updated delete-confirmation reupload handling to rebuild uploads from the current vault state.
- Added compatibility fixes for obsidian-paste-image-rename by preserving ctime on local file creation during pull and separating file vs folder stats in task interfaces.
- Adjusted conflict resolution logic to handle file-only conflicts more accurately.
- Added remote mkdir handling when reuploading deleted directories.
- Removed unnecessary recursive remote directory creation in mkdir handling.
- Eliminated unnecessary async calls in the two-way decider to improve planning performance.

### Localization, docs, and maintenance

- Added Russian translations for the webdav explorer UI.

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.1.0 - 2026-04-08

### Sync planning and execution

- Reworked two-way sync planning into explicit file/folder/file-folder collections, simplifying the decision flow and removing redundant per-path branching.
- Added cancelable traversal/planning by propagating throwIfCancelled through WebDAV traversal and decider loops.
- Changed task creation and optimization to run grouped mkdir/push/pull/remove/merge work concurrently.
- Renamed conflict handling from conflict-resolve to merge across planning, settings, UI, and migrations, and centralized merge snapshot handling.
- Simplified mkdir handling by removing recursive mkdir task chains and tightening path/subpath validation.
- Optimized delete/reupload syncing by replacing an O(n²) lookup with a Map, and improved task ordering by sorting directories via path segment depth.
- Consolidated traversal, path normalization, and stat conversion helpers into shared utilities, and removed the local-walk planning report.
- Simplify change detection and loose-mode handling

### Settings, localization, and UI

- Expanded i18n language handling with a shared language map, normalized auto-detection, and a fix for zh-Hans detection.
- Made language settings accept arbitrary values and populate the dropdown dynamically.
- Updated sync progress and observability UI to use i18n-driven run kinds, raw paths, and clearer percent/count display.
- Replaced the old sync run-type formatter with direct localization lookups and added/adjusted conflict-related translation keys.
- Replaced settings migration flow with a new processing pipeline and added the prune base text store migration.

### Logging and build output

- Enhanced logger output with plugin version and log-length information.
- Added a shared VERSION constant and wired version injection into the build config.

### Cleanup, performance, and internal API tightening

- Centralized ArrayBuffer-to-text conversion into a shared utility and removed duplicated serializers from task classes.
- Simplified task and engine internals by reducing noisy debug payloads, removing unused types/files, and cleaning imports.
- Corrected a misleading execution error message in AddRecordTask.
- Refined mergeability checks so base text is only computed when needed.

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.0.0 - 2026-04-05

### Huge Internal Refactor

**Many breaking changes are present although auto migration is provided. Strongly recommended to backup before upgrade.**

- Complete rewrite and simplification of storage layer to separated IndexedDB-backed stores for base text and sync records. Drastically reduced storage read / write overhead.
- Added safer key parsing and bulk `getItems/removeItems` helpers in storage to reduce round-trips.

- Parallelized traversal, storage and decision with conceivable 10-20x performance boost.
- Standardized previous IOS-specific strict directory path normalization to all platforms.
- Reworked sync task implementations to the new `record/StatsMap` model.
- Removed useless `noop` and `skip` tasks.
- Refurbished and renamed merge/remove task utilities.
- Added WebDAV runtime-configurable rate-liming settings.
- Organized settings UI.
- Added Russian locale (`src/i18n/ru.ts`) and related wiring.
- Two migration systems (v1.3.0 - v2.0.0) added and executed on plugin load:
  - Settings migration: `src/settings/migration.ts`

- Added new option "Clear records" to clear all local / records saved in local indexed database.

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v1.2.3 - 2026-03-22
